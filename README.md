## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop and analyze a high-performance solution for applying **3D coordinate transformations** (rotation, translation, scaling) using **parallel computing with CUDA**.

This implementation compares:
- Serial and parallel execution on **CPU**
- Fully parallelized transformation on **GPU (CUDA)**

Experiments were conducted on datasets containing **1 million** and **10 million** points.
